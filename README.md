# Nautilus-WSL-Launcher
A batch script for opening Nautilus (or other stuff) in VcXsrv from WSL 

# How to use it (how I use it lol)
Just copy the contents to wherever

Create a shortcut to the Nautilus.bat and slap it on ya desktop

Go ahead and set the shortcut's icon as the ico file I included for extra sauce ;)

# What this actually does
The script checks if vcxsrv.exe is running, if it isn't it'll open up a new instance via the xlaunch file (which you should probably double check works for your pc, if not generate your own in vcxsrv).
Then it runs Nautilus or XTerm or whatever the script is set to.
