# Nautilus-WSL-Launcher
A batch script for opening Nautilus in VcXsrv from WSL 

# How to use it (how I use it lol)
Just copy the contents to wherever

Create a shortcut to the Nautilus.bat and slap it on ya desktop

Go ahead and set the shortcut's icon as the ico file I included for extra sauce ;)
